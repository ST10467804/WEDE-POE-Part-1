    <p>Welcome to mental mainia, we are a non-proft orginisation thats main focus is to help those suffer from mental health problems 
        such as deprssion, sadness and lonliness. Our orginisation was founded in 2022 by a group of dedicated mental health professionals
         and willing volunteers who found that there are a large number of individuals that are suffering from depression, anxiety and loneliness. 
         These individuals do not have access to emotional and psychological support. What began as a small forum online has now turned into a registered and recognized non-profit organization
          that offers a range of both online and in person resources to combat mental problems. 
          <br> <br>
          Our goal is to provide a safe, inclusive and easily accessible platform for individuals with mental health problems, 
          fostering awareness support and healing through community engagement.
